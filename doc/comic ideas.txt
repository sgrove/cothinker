Poli speaking to greg (On a merry-go-round this time)

Poli: Greg, I find it highly offensive that you continue to denigrate politheism when it gives hope and financial success to so many people. Me in particular. What kin of a world would it be with no politheism? Politicians would lie, the would be massive wars throughout the world, people would literally *starve* to death. How is it that you're ok with that?

Greg: Well, people are not good just because politheism tells they should be. There's massive influence from society to conform to the norms, and that means treating people fairly, caring for others, etc. The fact is, even, or perhaps especially without politheism, humans would not accept others acting in what they felt was an unfair manner. 

Poli: I hear what your saying. But look at everything that would happen without politheism - wars, poverty, destruction, complete abdication of morality! How can you continue to rage against politheism in the face of such truths?
Greg: Poli, I believe that's the same exact argument you just used, just reworded a bit. And poorly reworded at that. And, for the record, each of those things you mentioned still happen.

Poli: Think past your hatred, and come to the issue with an open mind. Now, we have established that without politheism, the sun would burn out, the oceans would boil, and earth may in fact trip into a massive black hole, destroying our entire universe. How is it that you're so filled with spite that you welcome such a bleak future? Are you that depressed?
Greg: I think I'm ready to get off of this ride now...

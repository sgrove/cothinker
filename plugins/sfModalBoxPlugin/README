sfModalBoxPlugin symfony plugin
===============================

Overview
--------

sfgWidgetsPlugin provides symfony helpers for the Javascript gWidgets library ("widgets" all based on Prototype and pure css styling), currently including:

- gExpander: it is a very simple widget to toggle the visibility of a div. It adds an arrow image before the content (can be customized). It can also load the content in an ajax request if a different url is specified.

- gTab:  a simple and light tab widget ajax-enabled, accessible and unobtrusive(based on FabTabulous and inspiration from jQuery Tabs plugin).

- gBox: overlay a box with the specified inline or remote content, it can be an image or html content (a kind of mixed between lightbox and Thickbox).

- gTip: a simple tooltip solution (inspired by jTip)

= sfContactGrabberPlugin =

  The 'sfContactGrabberPlugin' will fetch your address book from yahoo and gmail.


== Requirements ==

  * PHP 5 with CURL support (curl.so or php_curl.dll)


== Installiation instructions ==

  * Install the plugin

  {{{
    symfony plugin-install http://plugins.symfony-project.com/sfContactGrabberPlugin
  }}}

  * Enable the sfContactGrabber module in your application settings.yml

  {{{
    all:
      .settings:
        enabled_modules:        [default, sfContactGrabber]
  }}}

  * Add a writable path for cookies. ( some of the scripts need this, eg: yahoo)
  So in config/app.yml add the following.

  {{{
    sfContactGrabberPlugin:
      cookie_path: somewhere/uploads
  }}}

  * Clear the cache

  {{{
    symfony cc
  }}}

  * Include a link to the form in a view

  {{{
    <?php include_partial('sfContactGrabber/form');?> 
  }}}




== Notes ==

  * A level of abstraction is made from the tpl's so they may be eaisly updated in the future as their api's change.
  Any changes made to them should be listed below.

=== Changes to third party librarys: ===

  * libgmailer:
    -line 564 ish, commented out the session start, as symfony deals with that.
    -link 5765 ish, addded 'static' to the function, as is it being called statically. (removes error messages)

== TODO ==

 * Test the myspace library (since it is sitting right there)
 * Add Hotmail, rediff and orkut support.

== Troubleshooting ==

 * When CURL is not present, you may get errors like: "Warning: dl() [function.dl]: Dynamically loaded extensions aren't enabled in ....." This is simple... go install CURL.

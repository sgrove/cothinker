<h3>What is cothink?</h3>
<p>Cothink is the place where professors, students, and community members collaborate to manage projects for the betterment of the world - and grades.</p>
<br />
<h3>And what's it for?</h3>
<p>Communities and universities have an abundance of talented people who could solve each other's problems if they worked together. But the unfocused nature of academic pursuits has produced sporadic attempts at applying them towards community benefit. Cothink changes all this by organizing the needs into projects and providing the framework, tools, and supportive community to help them solve problems.</p>
<br />
<h3>Ok, I'm convinced. I have a project, can I join?</h3>
<p>Depends. We love a good project, but projects posted on Cothink need to meet a few requirements. If you're an educational institution, or a non-profit organization we'll take close to anything you give us. Other areas are more murky - we're driven by our desire to help students apply their studies and benefit their communities in the process, not generate revenue for private companies. We have some plans along this line, but we want to be very careful the make sure that the students are compensated appropriately for whatever they produce.</p>
